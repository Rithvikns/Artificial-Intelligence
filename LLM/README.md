# üß† Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository provides a simple introduction to **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, how they can be used both locally and through hosted APIs, and the key differences between the two approaches.

## üîç What is an LLM?

A **Large Language Model** is an advanced type of AI trained on massive amounts of text data to understand, generate, and interact in natural language.

Popular LLMs include:

- [GPT-4 (OpenAI)](https://openai.com/)
- [Claude (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/)
- [LLaMA (Meta)](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)
- [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)
- [Gemini (Google)](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini)

LLMs power chatbots, coding assistants, summarizers, and many other AI-driven tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Examples of Using LLMs

### 1. Using a Hosted LLM (API-Based)

You can access models like GPT-4 using a hosted API service:

**Python Example with OpenAI:**
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

Other providers include:

Anthropic (Claude)

Cohere

Google (Gemini)

Mistral via Hugging Face

2. Running a Local LLM
You can also run models like LLaMA or Mistral on your own machine using libraries such as:

llama.cpp

text-generation-webui

transformers (Hugging Face)

Python Example using Transformers:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_name = "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

inputs = tokenizer("Hello, how are you?", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
Note: Running large models locally may require significant RAM or a GPU.

‚öñÔ∏è Hosted vs Local LLMs

Feature	Hosted LLM (API)	Local LLM
Ease of Use	Very simple (just use the API)	Requires setup and hardware
Cost	Pay-per-request or subscription	Free after setup (hardware-dependent)
Performance	Fast (cloud-scale)	Depends on your device
Privacy	Data sent to external server	Data stays on your machine
Customization	Limited to prompts	Full control & fine-tuning possible
Internet Needed	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No (runs offline)
